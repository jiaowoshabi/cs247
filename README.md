## User profile prediction in heterogeneous information networks

### Problem statement

This problem considers general networks, such as social network, citation network, and protein network, etc. The nodes in these network represent different users or entities. Usually, the profile information such as demographics, preferences, and profession is hardly complete. When dealing user/entity profile, the first thing that is needed is to complete the missing information. Therefore, suppose we only know small number of labels for peopleâ€™s ideology, profession, education, can we predict the remaining?
