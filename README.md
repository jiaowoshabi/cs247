## Health related topics

5. clinical predictive models on Eletronic Health Record (EHR) systems

This is a **diagnosis prediction task**, and its **goal** is to predict the furture health information of patients from their historical [Eletronic Healthcare Records (EHR)](https://www.healthit.gov/faq/what-electronic-health-record-ehr).

### Papers:

* [RETAIN: AN Interpretable Predictive Model for Healthcare using Reverse Time Attention Mechanism](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6321-retain-an-interpretable-predictive-model-for-healthcare-using-reverse-time-attention-mechanism)
* [KAME: Knowledge-based Attention Model for Diagnosis Prediction in Healthcare](http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~fenglong/files/2018/cikm18_kame.pdf)

### Github:
* [RETAIN](https://github.com/mp2893/retain)
* [Med2ve](https://github.com/mp2893/med2vec)
* ...

### Datasets:

I find this one very popular and is being used in **KAME** paper. We need to request the access to the dataset. It's not a big deal though.

* [MIMIC](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/)
  - MIMIC is an openly available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising deidentified health data associated with ~40,000 critical care patients. It includes demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more.
  - [Quick start guide](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access)

Rough idea:

For this project, we can **compare** the performance of different predictive models. Most of them are deep learning models. Probably we need GPU instances. We can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) for GPU accelaration.

The idea is preliminary, but we can discuss about it and then talk with prof.

6. Breast cancer prediction

This is a treatment prediction for breast cancer patients.

7. Kaggle competitions

We can choose some interesting datasets and projects on [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/tags/healthcare). What's wrong with getting the course project done and earning some money ðŸ˜ˆ.
